To publish for windows x64 use:

dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64

This is windows specific because of the Fortuna entropy sources (mouse, k/b). However, according to dotnet docs (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives), the preprocessor-directive we added should allow k/b and mouse when compiling for windows (doesn't seem to work for me, I am on latest dotnet 6.0).
